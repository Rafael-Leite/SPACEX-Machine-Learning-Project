# SPACEX-Machine-Learning-Project

This project was completed in order to attain the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. 

The purpose of the project was to implement machine learning models to try to predict whether rocket lauches from the SPACEx company would succesfully reutilize the first stage (bottom part) of the rocket, based on features of the rockets and the launch sites. The reutilization of the first stage saves the company millions of dollars in each launch, and it helps explain why SPACEX prices for rocket launches are so low in comparison to other private companies in the field.

Each jupyter notebook entails a different step of the analysis:
1) Data collection through SPACEx Public APIs
2) Data collection through Web Scraping of Wikipedia
3) Data wrangling with Pandas library
4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL, using the sqllite module
5) EDA through data visualization with Seaborn library
6) Interactive maps of the SPACEX Launch Sites and their proximities with Folium library
7) Interactive dashboards built with Plotly-Dash
8) Machine Learning Classification (logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, K-Nearest Neighbors)
